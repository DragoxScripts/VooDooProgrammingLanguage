# VooDoo Programming Language
A programming language based off of python.

This programming language was made as a challange to see what I can do with python.
The ideas come from python because it can do alot of things, athough voodoo can't do much yet.
The grammer and rules are also like python but much less powerful.
The reason I included the icon is because you can right click go into propreties, go into coustomize and change the icon.
Some of the structure is kind of like BASIC too.
